/**
 * Sync engine.
 *
 * One shared module for getting Glooko data into the archive, used by both the
 * MCP server (on its first tool call, and on explicit refresh) and the
 * standalone warm-up CLI. Having a single engine means the cold-start, top-up
 * and staleness logic is identical however it is triggered, so there is one
 * code path to trust.
 *
 * Design decisions (see the long discussion that produced this):
 *
 *  - COLD START walks forward from an env floor date (OMNI_OLDEST_DATE) in
 *    one-year batches, so no single Glooko request spans a huge range. It is
 *    RECENT-FIRST: the most recent batch is pulled and ingested before the
 *    older history, so the very first question is answerable quickly while the
 *    backfill continues.
 *
 *  - TOP-UP keys off the OLDEST of the per-stream maxima (store.getStreamMaxima
 *    -> coverageEpoch), NOT CGM recency alone. If one stream lagged a Glooko
 *    sync, keying off CGM would leave it permanently behind. A short trailing
 *    re-pull window also corrects late/provisional boundary readings.
 *
 *  - An in-process LOCK (syncInProgress) serialises everything. A query that
 *    arrives mid-pull awaits the same promise rather than starting a second
 *    Glooko session or reading a half-written DB. This is the single safeguard
 *    that makes background backfill and foreground reads coexist safely.
 *
 *  - STALENESS is reported, never auto-actioned mid-session. Tools call
 *    describeStaleness() and surface the flag; the user chooses to refresh,
 *    which calls topUp() (same engine). The only automatic pull is the one at
 *    first-call cold start / initial top-up.
